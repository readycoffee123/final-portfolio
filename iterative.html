			<div class ="development-about">
				<p> "Iterative Redesign" was a group project that I completed as part of my UIUX course (CSCI1300) at Brown University. Our goal was to pick an emerging startup and design an interactive interface for that startup, going through the process of figuring out a mock solution for that startup.</p>

			<div class ="development-content">
				<p> We picked a startup called as NEEDL, which aims to provide a search mechanism across different apps. We found it to be an interesting problem to tackle, searching across different platforms and mediums. We tried to re-design their startup app and additionally create a similar solution without looking at their prototypes.</p>

				<h1>Explanation of the prototype</h1>
				<p> This prototype aims to enable users to search for a concept across multiple platforms and filter by date or platform, or create their own bundles. Bundles are a concept that we've created which helps the users group their favorite filters and searches in an easier way for smoother searches. </p>
			</div>



			<div class ="development-content">
				<h1> We tested our design using UserTesting.com </h1>
				<h3> Some of the testing questions we used included: </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Did you find the distinction between individual filter and bundle selection clear?</li>
					<li>Did you find any aspects of the design not clear or hard to understand?</li>
					<li>What did you like about this website?</li>
					<li>What would you have liked to be able to do with this website, but weren't able to?</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Feedback we have received included </h3>
				<ul>
					<li> Most of the users were satisfied with the overall workflow and found the interface "easy to navigate". The users also liked the concept of the interface where they can easily search for a document or an email across multiple platforms at the same time, which is handy when the user doesn't know where the document is</li>
					<li> One of the users indicated how they thought the interface was like a "google for a computer"</li>
					<li> There were a couple glitches in our instructions that we gave, so some of the users complained about the instructions rather than the interface itself</li>
					<li> One of the testers had a problem with adding a filter, which was indicated with a plus sign in our Figma file. </li>
					<li> Another users struggled to go back to the initial search page</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>What I learned / Challenges </h1>
				<p> This project helped me learn how to work wth a group (other students in UIUX) and gave me a perspective in how it feels like to work with other UIUX professionals in a more professional platform. Additionally, it gave us a perspective on what it feels like to be a part of a startup and find a problem which we care and find ways to solve it in a feasable manner. </p>
				<p> It was additionally very helpful to use the usertesting.com platform to hear about other people's thoughts on our interface. After hearing from them, we will fix all these problems in the near future. This project showed me how developing prototypes require the input of other people and their user experiences.</p>
