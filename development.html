				<p> "Development" was a project I worked on while taking the course UIUX (CSCI1300) while I was a student at Brown University. The project aims to develop an interactive interface using interface components and a database that the website uses, utilizing React. </p>

				<h1>The Goal and Value of the Application</h1>
				<p>The goal of this web application was to create a digital cookbook where users can use it for their favorite recipes where they can sort/filter according to calories, cook time, difficulty, and meal type. This is especially designed for people who do not have enough time to find recipes that are appropriate for their schedules, time that they have for cooking, and the type of meal that they'd like to eat. I wanted to design something that is easy to use, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. This application also provides a total calorie count for users who are curious about what they're eating and how much to eat more for a healthy calorie amount</p>

				<h1>Usability Principles Considered</h1>
				<p>This web application considers the best and most optimal sorting and filtering options that the users might benefit from. These include cooktime to make sure that the recipe that the user wants is suitable for the amount of time that they can spare, calorie information to make sure that the user is getting enough and sufficient calories and nutrients, filtering by meal type to enable the users to find the recipe that they would like, and a "favorites" section where users can add the meals or drinks they like to refer back to and see their calorie information, if they'd like to. The users can additionally can filter for easy or hard recipes. This is designed for users who are not confident in their cooking recipes and would prefer easy recipes or users who do not have enough time for cooking for that particular time.</p>
				<p> The website is organized in a way that it is easy to view the recipes and also the dishes. If the user hovers over, they can see the ingredient lists, which is only available upon hovering to reduce the information overload. Additionally, each recipe includes a short description on what is the recipe to give a quick information for the user, if the user doesn't know what to pick.</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "development-content">
				<h1>Organization of Components</h1>
				<p>The organization of the website includes a component structure for a single FoodCard (FoodCard.js).</p>
				<p>FoodCard represents each Item in the website, where Items are each recipes listed in the page. Each card includes information regarding the image for the recipe, the description of the item, category of the meal, the cooktime for the meal or drink, the difficulty, calorie information, and the name of the recipe. This information will be filled by the JSON file where each information is stored.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="development-content">
				<h1>How the User Triggers State Changes</h1>
				<p>The user can do three things from this website: sorting, filtering, and adding it to their favorites cart to display the total number of calories. If the user wants to sort anything, They can either sort by calories or cooktime. In either way, the constant sortstuff is used. This constant has an if-else statement where if the value is false, the items will be sorted by cook time and if it is true, the items will be sorted by calories. When the user wants to sort, the useEffect() function will be called, which makes all the sorting and filtering work togehter using a dependency array. Filtering works in a similar way with constants filterResult (to filter category - dinner, dessert, drinks) and filterResultDifficulty (to filter category - easy or hard). These all again get activated with useEffect() function with a dependency array to update the resultant array.</p>
				<p>There's also the functionality where users can add recipes to their favorites cart. This happens when the user clicks on the button located below each cart item. The favorites cart is displayed on the left hand side of the page and it also displays the total calorie count for the items in the favorites cart. The users can remove the items from the cart using the red "X" button located next to each item listed (and the calorie count updates automatically whenever the user adds or removes an item from the favorites cart).</p>
				<p>The total calories displayed is calculated using the constant calcTotalCalories, which adds up the calorie values for each item located in the favorites cart. When the user pushes the button "add to favorites", the card is added to cart object and when the user wants to remove something from the cart, the object is deleted from the cart using the splice function.</p>

				<h1>What I learned / Challenges </h1>
				<p> This was my first ever React project. It was challenging to understand the concept of components and how React works. It was also challenging to develop something which is easy to use and user friendly for users, making it easier for them to pick their favorite recipe in limited time. I learned how to design effectively in a way that the design will be appropriate for users' purposes.  </p>
